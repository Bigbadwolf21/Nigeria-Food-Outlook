# Nigeria Food Outlook Analysis

## Project Description

This project analyzes the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) dataset on Livestock and Crop Production for Nigeria (1961 to 2023) to explore the country's food production landscape. The notebook investigates production trends of key agricultural commodities, examines crop yields, and provides a data-driven narrative on Nigeria's agricultural strengths and areas for potential growth.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "FAO_Nigeria_Food_Outlook.csv", obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. It contains data related to various agricultural elements (e.g., Production, Yield, Stocks) for different items (crops and livestock) in Nigeria over a range of years.

## Analysis and Findings

The analysis in this notebook covers:

- **Top Commodities in 2023:** Identification of the top 10 most produced agricultural items in Nigeria in the year 2023.
- **Long-Term Production Trends:** Examination of the production trends for key crops (Cassava, Maize, Rice, Wheat, and Yams) from 1961 to 2023.
- **Crop Yield Analysis:** Analysis of the yield per hectare for the selected key crops from 1990 onwards to understand land productivity.
- **Cassava vs Wheat Production:** A direct comparison of the production volumes of Cassava and Wheat in 2023 to highlight their relative scale.

Key findings include the dominance and significant growth of Cassava and Yams production, variations in yield across different crops, and the substantial difference in production volume between staple crops like Cassava and other crops like Wheat.

## Visualizations

The notebook includes several visualizations to support the analysis:

- Bar chart showing the top 10 produced items in Nigeria (2023).
- Line plot illustrating the long-term production trends for selected crops (1961-2023).
- Individual line plots showing the yield trends for each selected crop (1990-2023).
- Bar chart comparing Cassava and Wheat production in 2023.

## How to Run the Notebook
